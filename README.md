## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

Since I had no previous programming experience (only knew HTML and CSS), this project was challenging. However, I realized there are some parallels between building an app with swift and xcode, and building a website. By the end I was getting pretty familiar with the different components of a swift class, and how they interact with each other, with the views, and with the components of another class to make possible the functioning of an app. Great learning experience!
